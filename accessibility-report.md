For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:

(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours 

### Equitable use
The read aloud feature made sure even blind people can know what is in the to do list.

### Flexibility in use
We added due date, notification and the schedule to the todo items, which will make the user experience more convenient.

### Simple and intuitive use
Our app has a simple UI, and the features are straight forward, making it simple to use for everyone.

### Perceptible information:
Our schedule view made sure the todo item can be viewed more easily in terms of deadlines.

### Tolerance for error
We did not implement much related to error tolerance. But in the future we can implement error checking specifically for duplicated titles to prevent confusion.

### Low physical effort
It does not apply to our app since its just a simple to do list.

### Size and space for approach and use
It does not apply to our app since its just a simple to do list.

Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

We could market it to students and project managers, since they have to deal with deadlines of items with different priorities (homework, project tasks, etc)

Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.

I think our program is likely to be used by all demographics. Cause different age groups, sex, professions might need a todo list to manage their everyday tasks.
